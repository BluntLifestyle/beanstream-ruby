# Bambora's Ruby SDK

Integration with Bamboraâ€™s payments gateway is a simple, flexible solution.

You can choose between a straightforward payment requiring very few parameters; or, you can customize a feature-rich integration.

To assist as a centralized record of all your sales, we also accept cash and cheque transactions.

For very detailed information on the Payments API, look at the Bambora developer portal's [documentation](http://developer.beanstream.com/documentation/take-payments/purchases-pre-authorizations/).
